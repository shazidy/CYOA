    /**
     * SuperTale is a very short, very unfinished game with huge potential.
     * A simple CYOA game with RPG elements.
     * Battle is handled in a separated class and works as intended even keeping the updated playerStats for
     * next enemy encounter. Both Player and Enemy has their own class and creates a specific instance of their
     * respective objects when instantiated. Everything from stats, items and even death-string is instantiated
     * in Location class along with the main text of the story. Only A, B and C are valid options at the moment
     * since exceptions hasn't been handled in the Battle class.
     * We chose to keep text and choices together in their respective methods, as there are conditions that, when
     * returned to a method can create different branches going from that method, as each method also serves as
     * a situation/location in the world. It works and gives an okay overview of where each method leads to if
     * the accompanying booleans are aptly named to reflect to which method they belong.
